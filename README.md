## [Midd360°: A 360° Indoor-tour of campus for prospective students]
### Middlebury College, Computer Science CSCI 701 (Fall 2021)
### Cynthia Chen, Yaqi Huang,and Leili Manafi

### about
The current prospective student tour system is not comprehensive nor accessible enough; 
Students can’t see interior of buildings and virtual tours are not immersive.

Our tour is interactive and self guided, there is indoor view of campus buildings--Davis, Axinn and McCullough Student center--
and it is a platform that can be continued...
We have also included an instructions file to allow for further build of this project.
